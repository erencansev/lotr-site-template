# Lord Of The Rings site Template

live  -> https://lotr-site-template.netlify.app/


My project is a web design inspired by The Lord of the Rings. The goal was to improve my knowledge of the SCSS language and use my imagination to create an interesting design. I used HTML, CSS, and SCSS technologies for this project. However, at this moment, the project is optimized only for desktop browsers. I am planning to make it mobile-friendly in the future and publish it. And you can visit the live version of the website on netlify.
